# Game Project
##### Story
The story of the game is of a Lonley Foot where he was onces a whole body, but got struck by ligthing and all his body parts where gone
and some how the only body part that survived was his foot, and the foot later heard that his body was all over the world and he's going
on a mission to find his bodypart.
##### Game type
The game that I'm working on is a 2D action game where the user takes control of The Lonely Foot, he's on his quest
togather all his body part to become whole again.
As the game is a 2D game, and the first game in unity that I have worked on, I have spent most of my time learning how to use unity,
that maybe seen as the project is taking a lot of time and there's not that much to show for it, but I have learned how to make some
sprites and how to animate them in unity using the animation tools that unity has.
